## Introduction

Google Colab or Google Colaboratory is an online free tool provided by Google.
This tool gives access to some compute resources, including GPU hardware, to anybody with just a Google account, internet access and a browser.
The idea is to use this available computer power through notebooks and it is focused on data analysis and machine learning tasks.
It is primarily intended for Python code, but it is also possible to use this tool with the R programming language.
This short tutorial provides a simple step by step guide on how to run R code in Google Colab.
Even though there seems to be a way to use the rpy2 Python package and use run through the Python interpreter, this tutorial focuses on the direct use of the R runtime.

## Step by Step

### 1. Connect to the Internet and open your favourite browser
The current tutotorial has been prepared using the latest version of Google Chrome and it might make sense to recommend the use of that browser since it is developed by the same company that provides the Colab tool.
### 2. Sign-in to a Google account
Without a Google Account an error window stating 'Google sign-in required'  will be shown.
In any case, most people would like to keep their work from one session to the next and have the capacity of sharing notebooks with others.
### 3. Go to the Google Colab Site
The user will be prompted to select ...
